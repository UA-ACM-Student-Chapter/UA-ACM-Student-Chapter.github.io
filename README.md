## About
**What the heck is this for?**

* This is our website! It contains the kind of information most professional student organizations would have.

**Through what sorcery is this achieved?**

* There are quite a few resources we used, which are all open source, to implement our site:
  * Bootstrap 4: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap
    * Adds great looking layouts and elements
  * jQuery 3.3.1: https://github.com/jquery/jquery
    * Makes doing cool stuff to the DOM in Javascript easy
  * Fontello: https://github.com/fontello/fontello
    * Lets you use custom icons without downloading all of Font Awesome
  * Braintree Payments: https://github.com/braintree
    * They provide an easy way to do PCI compliant payments
  * FormatGoogleCalendar: https://github.com/MilanLund/FormatGoogleCalendar
    * Defeats Google Calendar's ugly, ugly old blue embeddable iframe widget
  * Javascript Obfuscator: https://github.com/javascript-obfuscator/javascript-obfuscator/
    * Makes the scripts tiny
