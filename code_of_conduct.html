        <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

        <p>The University of Alabama's Association for Computing Machinery (UA ACM) believes in inclusivity, and does not tolerate harassment.
        Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or written comments related to
        gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion,
        social class, economic status, veteran status, sexual images, deliberate intimidation,
        stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or
        other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

        <p>At our events and activities, members asked to stop behavior identified as harrasing are expected to immediately comply.
        UA ACM reserves the right to take any action deemed appropriate for dealing with harrasing behavior, including removing the 
        offending member from the event and banning from future events or revoking membership.</p>

        <p>We expect participants of our events to follow these rules at all venues, online interactions in
        relation to the event.</p>

        <h3>Reporting Procedures</h3>
        <p>If you feel uncomfortable or think there may be a potential violation of the code of conduct,
        please report it immediately to an ACM officer at the event, or to acm-off@listserv.ua.edu. All reporters have the
        right to remain anonymous.</p>
